# Panacea Testnet

The Panacea Testnet is a playground to test transactions and queries.
It doesn't support the Faucet and most of tokens were already bonded.
So, if you want to test your own validator nodes, please use the [Panacea Public Testnet](https://github.com/medibloc/panacea-public-testnet) instead.

This repo contains genesis files of all historical chains of the Panacea Testnet.
